We worked on an algorithmic pipeline to detect and measure heart rates of subjects from video streams of their faces. This pipeline includes a slightly modified face detection algorithm, skin segmentation, pulse extraction, and peak detection. These processes, and results, in the pipeline are explained in depth in the paper attached. The processes in the pipeline outside of the face detection algorithm, as well as different versions of the processes, are included in the matlab codes folder.
