We worked on an algorithmic pipeline to detect and measure heart rates of subjects from video streams of their faces. This pipeline includes a slightly modified face detection algorithm, skin segmentation, pulse extraction, and peak detection. These processes, and results, in the pipeline are explained in depth in the paper attached.
